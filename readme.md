# About
A simple mini JavaScript project which gives a random quote every time the page gets reloaded or the "Get New Note" button is clicked. 
The name of the author is also mentioned at the end of each quote.

This mini project uses the [Quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) API, which is a free open source quotation API.
